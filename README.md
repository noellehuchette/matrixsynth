# Matrix Synth

## A synthesizer/sequencer app using Tone.js and React

Based on an flash app that made the rounds a while back.

Made over a weekend during bootcamp using create-react-app for boilerplate code.

###  wishlist
- refactor to use react hooks *(in progress)*
- voice control (oscillator selector, amp envelope, FM/AM options)
- additional modules (filter & ADSR envelope, stereo spread, rhythm section)
- effects & modulation (reverb, delay, distortion, LFO, chorus controls)
- improved styling and performance
