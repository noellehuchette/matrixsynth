# Matrix Synth

## A synthesizer/sequencer app using Tone.js and React

Based on an flash app that made the rounds a while back.

Made over a weekend during bootcamp using create-react-app for boilerplate code.

11/13/22 - refactored to use react hooks 

12/2/22 - added oscillator selector, amp envelope, and basic filter

###  wishlist
- voice saving
- voice control (FM/AM options)
- additional modules (stereo spread, rhythm section)
- effects & modulation (reverb, delay, distortion, LFO, chorus controls)
- improved styling and performance
